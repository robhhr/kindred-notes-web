          <p className="paragraph">
            A Kindrednote is just what it sounds like, a kind note. It could be
            a simple note to say something kind or a quote thatâ€™s had a positive
            impact. It could be a story, an experience or a thought. Our
            intention is to spread kindness and increase empathy by
            demonstrating that despite our many differences in perspectives,
            beliefs and values, that at the core, we are all the same.
