      <h2>What is a KindredNote?</h2>

      <p>
        A Kindrednote is just what it sounds like, a kind note. It could be a
        simple note to say something kind or a quote thatâ€™s had a positive
        impact. It could be a story, an experience or a thought. Our intention
        is to spread kindness and increase empathy by demonstrating that despite
        our many differences in perspectives, beliefs and values, that at the
        core, we are all the same.
